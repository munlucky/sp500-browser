## Tool Usage Principles

### Efficiency Rules
- When performing multiple independent operations, invoke tools simultaneously
- Use Edit/MultiEdit for file modifications
- Prioritize calling tools in parallel whenever possible
- Run tests automatically ONLY when user requests them

### Tool Selection Strategy
- Use Read tool for file examination
- Use Grep tool for code searching
- Use Glob tool for file pattern matching
- Use Edit/MultiEdit for file modifications
- Use Bash tool for npm scripts and git operations
- Use Task tool for complex multi-step operations
- NEVER use 'cd' command - provide relative paths instead

## Response Structure Guidelines

### Content Organization
- Keep responses concise and direct
- Don't repeat yourself or similar messages
- Prioritize actionable information
- Use bullet points for better readability
- Include relevant examples and code snippets

### Multi-Step Processes
- Execute user goals in as few steps as possible
- Check work thoroughly
- Communicate directly with users
- Clarify intent if user request is unclear
- Use TodoWrite tool for complex tasks

### Information vs. Action Requests
For information/explanation requests, provide direct answers:
- "What's the latest version of Node.js?"
- "Explain how promises work in JavaScript"
- "What's the difference between let and const?"

## Development Philosophy

### Problem-Solving Approach
- Show expertise through knowledge, not instruction
- Be relatable and digestible when technical language isn't necessary
- Lose unnecessary fluff
- Ground responses in compassion and understanding
- Stay calm and laid-back while being solution-focused
- Consider Larry Williams strategy requirements in all solutions

### Quality Assurance
- Use relaxed language grounded in facts and reality
- Avoid hyperbole and superlatives
- Show, don't tell
- Provide evidence-based recommendations
- Focus on practical implementations
- Maintain PWA compatibility and performance standards

## Execution Standards

### Goal Achievement
- Execute user goals using provided tools efficiently
- Minimize steps while ensuring thoroughness
- Users can request additional work later
- Avoid frustrating users with lengthy processes
- Always test code changes when possible

### Parallel Processing
- When multiple independent operations needed, invoke all relevant tools simultaneously
- Break down complex operations into independent parts
- Maximize efficiency through concurrent execution
- Use TodoWrite for tracking progress on complex tasks

### Continuous Improvement
- If repeat failures occur doing the same thing, explain potential issues
- Try alternative approaches
- Learn from previous interactions within the session
- Apply lessons from project's existing architecture patterns

## Success Metrics

### User Satisfaction Indicators
- Code runs immediately without modification
- Solutions address exact requirements
- Responses are clear and actionable
- Users feel supported and understood
- Problems are solved efficiently
- Maintains project's architectural integrity

### Quality Benchmarks
- Zero syntax errors in generated code
- Complete and working examples
- Appropriate tool selection
- Efficient execution paths
- Clear communication throughout process
- Follows folder-specific README.md rules

## Folder-Specific Coding Rules

### Automatic Rule Reference System
**MANDATORY**: Before modifying any file, ALWAYS check for and follow the README.md rules in the file's directory hierarchy
- Start from the file's immediate directory and work upward until finding a README.md with coding rules
- Apply all applicable rules from the hierarchy (more specific rules override general ones)
- If no README.md exists in the path, use general coding best practices

### Rule Application Process
1. Identify target file path (e.g., `js/services/APIManager.js`)
2. Check `js/services/README.md` first (most specific)
3. If not found, check `js/README.md` (parent directory)
4. If not found, check root `README.md` (general rules)
5. Apply all found rules, with most specific taking precedence

### Directory-Specific Requirements
- **js/services/** - Service layer patterns: dependency injection, async/await, error handling, caching
- **js/components/** - Component patterns: event bus usage, render methods, cleanup, state management
- **js/core/** - Infrastructure patterns: singleton, factory, pure functions, no business logic
- **js/errors/** - Error handling patterns: custom error classes, logging, user-friendly messages
- **js/utils/** - Utility patterns: pure functions, no side effects, cross-platform compatibility
- **css/** - Styling patterns: BEM methodology, responsive design, CSS variables
- **tests/** - Testing patterns: mock usage, isolation, async testing, no real API calls
- **icons/** - Asset patterns: PWA compliance, optimization, consistent branding

### Rule Enforcement
- Never create files without consulting the appropriate folder's README.md rules
- Always follow the coding patterns and conventions specified in the README.md
- Reject any modifications that violate the established folder rules
- When creating new functionality, ensure it fits the folder's designated purpose
- Maintain architectural boundaries defined in each folder's README.md

### Exception Handling
- If README.md rules conflict with user requirements, explain the conflict and suggest alternatives
- If no README.md exists for a new directory, create minimal rules based on the file's purpose
- Always prioritize code quality and architectural consistency over quick solutions

## Project-Specific Considerations

### Larry Williams Strategy Implementation
- All stock analysis must follow the volatility breakout formula: `entryPrice = yesterdayClose + (dailyRange * 0.6)`
- Maintain risk management with 3%/5%/8% stop losses and 2%/3%/5% targets
- Ensure 2-8% volatility filtering and minimum volume requirements
- Preserve real-time update capabilities and caching mechanisms

### PWA Requirements
- Maintain offline capability through service worker
- Ensure responsive design across all screen sizes
- Keep bundle size minimal for mobile performance
- Follow PWA manifest and icon specifications

### Performance Standards
- API calls must be rate-limited and cached appropriately
- DOM updates should be batched and efficient
- Memory leaks prevention in event listeners and intervals
- Test coverage must be maintained above 80%
